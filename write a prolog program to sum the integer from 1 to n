% sum_up_to(N, Sum)
% This predicate calculates the sum of integers from 1 to N.

% Base case: The sum up to 0 is 0.
sum_up_to(0, 0).

% Recursive case:
% To find the sum up to N, we sum N with the sum up to N-1.
% N_minus_1 is N - 1.
% Recursive_sum is the sum up to N_minus_1.
% Sum is N + Recursive_sum.
sum_up_to(N, Sum) :-
    N > 0,              % Ensure N is a positive integer
    N_minus_1 is N - 1, % Calculate N-1
    sum_up_to(N_minus_1, Recursive_sum), % Recursively find the sum up to N-1
    Sum is N + Recursive_sum. % Add N to the recursive sum to get the final sum

% Example usage:
% To find the sum up to 5:
% ?- sum_up_to(5, S).
% S = 15.

% To find the sum up to 10:
% ?- sum_up_to(10, Result).
% Result = 55.
