% Base case: An empty string has zero vowels.
count_vowels([], 0).

% Recursive case: Check if the head of the list is a vowel.
count_vowels([H|T], Count) :-
    member(H, [a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U]), % Check for vowels
    count_vowels(T, CountTail),
    Count is CountTail + 1. % Increment count if H is a vowel

count_vowels([H|T], Count) :-
    \+ member(H, [a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U]), % If H is not a vowel
    count_vowels(T, Count). % Continue with the tail
