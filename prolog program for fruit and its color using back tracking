% This Prolog program defines facts about fruits and their associated colors.
% It is designed to illustrate Prolog's backtracking mechanism when querying.

% fruit_color(Fruit, Color).
% Defines a fact stating that a particular Fruit has a particular Color.

fruit_color(apple, red).
fruit_color(apple, green).
fruit_color(apple, yellow).
fruit_color(banana, yellow).
fruit_color(grape, purple).
fruit_color(grape, green).
fruit_color(lemon, yellow).
fruit_color(orange, orange).
fruit_color(strawberry, red).
fruit_color(blueberry, blue).

% Example queries to demonstrate backtracking:

% 1. What color is an apple?
% ?- fruit_color(apple, Color).
% Color = red ;   % Prolog finds the first match
% Color = green ; % On backtracking (pressing ';'), it finds the next
% Color = yellow. % And the next, until no more matches are found.

% 2. What fruit is red?
% ?- fruit_color(Fruit, red).
% Fruit = apple ;
% Fruit = strawberry.

% 3. What fruits are yellow?
% ?- fruit_color(Fruit, yellow).
% Fruit = apple ;
% Fruit = banana ;
% Fruit = lemon.

% 4. List all fruit-color pairs:
% ?- fruit_color(Fruit, Color).
% Fruit = apple, Color = red ;
% Fruit = apple, Color = green ;
% Fruit = apple, Color = yellow ;
% Fruit = banana, Color = yellow ;
% Fruit = grape, Color = purple ;
% Fruit = grape, Color = green ;
% Fruit = lemon, Color = yellow ;
% Fruit = orange, Color = orange ;
% Fruit = strawberry, Color = red ;
% Fruit = blueberry, Color = blue.

% 5. Find if a specific fruit-color combination exists:
% ?- fruit_color(banana, yellow).
% true.

% 6. Find if a non-existent fruit-color combination exists:
% ?- fruit_color(apple, blue).
% false.
